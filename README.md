## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming methodology
- Accessibility practices

### What I learned

This project helped me practice writing more maintainable CSS using root variables and BEM naming convention. It also helped me practice using semantic HTML.

```css
.card__btn:hover,
.card__btn:focus {
   background-color: var(--clr-primary);
   color: var(--clr-gray-900);
   outline: none;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to practice more efficient and consistent margin/padding and font sizes to make the project look more organized and professional.
